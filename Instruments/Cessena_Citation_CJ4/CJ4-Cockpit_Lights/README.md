## Left To Do:

## Notes:
 - This has no background associated with it directly. You may use the AirManager settings to create one.
 - The aircraft loads in the sim with the potentiometers already set to 1.0 but the lights are off, thus causing the knobs to already be maxed out even though the light is off. Recomend just turning them all the way of and then back off when you start the sim. If they resolve this in future releases, the knobs will start off correctly.
