## Notes:
- This control allows you to have a day / night cycle in your Air Manager CJ4 cockpit that follows the light cycle in MSFS. Using time, date, latitude, longitude and altitude, it will calculate the angle of the sun and determine the ambient brightness and control the background brightness in all your Simstrumentation CJ4 cockpit instruments accordingly.
