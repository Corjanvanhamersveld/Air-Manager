## Notes:
- This control allows you to have a day / night cycle in your Air Manager CJ4 cockpit that follows the light cycle in MSFS. Using time, date, latitude, longitude and altitude, it will calculate the angle of the sun and determine the ambient brightness and control the background brightness in all your Simstrumentation CJ4 cockpit instruments accordingly. 
- When in MANUAL mode, you can change dimming of your instruments via either the DAY / NIGHT buttons or via the knob
- Knob, DAY and NIGHT buttons are INOP in AUTO mode
- User properties will allow you to set it to run in either MANUAL or AUTO modes.
