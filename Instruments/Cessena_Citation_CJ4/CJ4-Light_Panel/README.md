## Cessna Citation CJ4 Light Control Panel

v1.0 8-2-21 Joe "Crunchmeister" Gilker
	- Original Panel Created
v1.1 8-29-21 Todd "Toddimus831" Lorey 
	- Added seatbelt, safety and pulse light functionality
v1.2 8-30-21 Rob "FlightLevelRob" Verdon	
	- Added variable subscribe for lights: Beacon,Nav,Strobe,Taxi,LNDG,Logo,Belt,Safety,RecLt. 
	- Removed toggle code now that variable subscribe is working.
	
## Left To Do:
	- Dimming Dials
	
## Notes:
	- TCAS is INOP in game. Not used.
	- You may have to push the in-game cockpit buttons twice to turn off a light if you turned it on from AirManager. Not sure if a WT issue or Asbro issue. The "toggle" events do not seem to update tooltips, could probably use LVARS as it does update when using ExtController.
