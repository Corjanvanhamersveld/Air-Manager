## Notes:
- TCAS is INOP in game. Not used.
- You may have to push the in-game cockpit buttons twice to turn off a light if you turned it on from AirManager. Not sure if a WT issue or Asbro issue. The "toggle" AM events do not seem to update tooltips, could probably use LVARS as it does update when using a ExtController.
