## Details

<p>This is a combination of the center console panels for the engine controls paired up with the trim control panel. Normally the throttle quadrant, speed brake and flaps control occupy the space between them on the console. The throttle, speed brake and flap controls weren't included in this instrument as it would make it larger than most peoples' screens can handle and most people already have dedicated throttles and don't need virtual ones in Air Manager. </p>

## Notes:
- Protective covers on RUN buttons functional. Touch or click the cover hinges to open and close. Run switches will be INOP until covers are open.
- Must use the Simstrumentation Ambient Light Dimmer control in order to use night lighting mode
  

## Left To Do:
 - Secondary Elev Trim is inop.
