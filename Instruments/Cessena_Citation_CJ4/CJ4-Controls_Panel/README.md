## Details

<p>This is the center console incorporating the engine run, starter and trim controls paired with the engine run / start controls. Normally the throttle quadrant would be between these 2 sections on the center console but weren't included in this instrument as most people have dedicated throttles and don't need virtual ones in Air Manager. </p>

<h4>REQUIRES Mobiflight-event-module in community folder  </h4>
<p>You can download Mobiflight at https://www.mobiflight.com/en/download.html</p>
<H6>NOTE: The eventual goal is to remove Mobiflight as a requirement for this instrument in a future version.</H6>
