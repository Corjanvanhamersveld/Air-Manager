</h2>

The Ambient Light Dimmer (ALD) has built in functionality to dim a Philips Hue Group using a WiFi Arduino.

The most stable Arduino tested is the Arduino Nano 33 IOT. The Arduino Script is built for that model Arduino, other models may need adjusting.

There are debugging features, and because the Nano 33 IOT has a second UART Serial onboard, debug messages are set to that, and you may listen to them using a PC serial port, or second Arduino. In the debugging folder the second Arduino tested was the original Arduino Nano. There is also a wiring diagram provided.
